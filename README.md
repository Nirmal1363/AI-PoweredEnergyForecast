This repository presents the implementation of machine learning models to predict energy consumption in smart homes. The project integrates **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM** models in an ensemble to improve the prediction accuracy of energy usage, a critical aspect of smart grid systems.

The repository also explores insights from the research paper: *"Transformative Potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Energy Sector: Smart Grids"* by Nirmal K, Varun Mandepudi, and Shreyan Krishnaa. The paper highlights the potential of AI and machine learning in enhancing smart grids by addressing challenges related to energy consumption, demand forecasting, and power distribution management.

## Project Overview
This project implements machine learning models to forecast energy consumption in smart homes. The integration of AI and machine learning into smart grids enables accurate predictions, optimizing energy management and demand forecasting in real-time.

Three key models are used in this work:
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method for capturing non-linear relationships in energy data.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that efficiently handles large datasets and complex patterns.
- **LSTM**: A recurrent neural network designed for time-series data, particularly effective for energy consumption patterns over time.

The ensemble model combines these individual models to leverage their strengths and minimize individual weaknesses, providing more stable and accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study simulates energy consumption and production in smart homes. It contains various features such as:
- **Energy Consumption**: The primary target variable representing daily energy usage (in kilowatt-hours, kWh).
- **Energy Production**: The energy generated by homes, often from renewable sources like solar panels.
- **Temporal Data**: Includes features such as the day of the year, month, and weekday/weekend indicators.
- **Weather Conditions**: Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, which impact energy consumption.
- **Home Activity**: Information on the number of occupants and the usage of appliances, which influence daily energy consumption patterns.

This dataset is ideal for predicting future energy consumption as it reflects real-world scenarios of fluctuating demand in smart grids.

## Modeling Approach
Three models were developed to predict energy consumption, each catering to different aspects of the data:

- **Random Forest Regressor**: Captures non-linear relationships and provides insights into feature importance.
- **XGBoost Regressor**: Effectively models complex data patterns and enhances performance on structured data.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Suitable for time-series forecasting, capturing long-term dependencies in sequential energy consumption data.

An **ensemble approach** was used to combine the strengths of these models by averaging their predictions. This method increases the overall accuracy and robustness of the predictions.

### Evaluation Metrics:
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides a more sensitive measure by giving higher weight to large errors.

The ensemble model produced the following results:
- **MAE**: 1415.19
- **RMSE**: 1671.86

## Implementation
The implementation was carried out using Python and popular machine learning libraries like **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**. 

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was preprocessed by scaling the energy consumption and input features using `MinMaxScaler`. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Each model was trained on the preprocessed data. The Random Forest and XGBoost models captured structured patterns, while the LSTM model handled temporal dependencies.
- **Ensemble Prediction**: The predictions from each model were combined through averaging to create the final forecast.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models was evaluated using MAE and RMSE, which confirmed that the ensemble model provided improved prediction accuracy.

## Results
The ensemble of **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **LSTM** models achieved a significantly lower error compared to individual models. By combining these models, the ensemble approach mitigated overfitting and improved the generalization of the model on unseen data.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 1415.19
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 1671.86

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble approach for energy consumption forecasting in smart grid systems.

## Visualizations
The results are presented in both graphical and tabular formats to allow for easy comparison between actual and predicted values.

### Pictorial Representation:
A line plot was generated comparing actual energy consumption values with the predicted values over the test period, providing an intuitive visual assessment of model performance.

### Tabular Representation:
A table was also generated showing actual vs. predicted values, along with future predictions for energy consumption. This provides a detailed, numerical comparison of the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.
